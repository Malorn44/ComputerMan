# ComputerMan
a Discord bot for the RPI student server.

Currnently a work in progress. Planned features include

- Automatic one-time-password verification of student status using RCS IDs, including automatic directory checking to filter out faculty/staff
- Adding and removing students from opt-in channels like #intense-discussion
- Purging users' messages at request for privacy protection
- Moderation capabilities, including kicking, banning, muting
- Various student information capabilities such as forwarding public safety alerts, retrieving catalog information, and professor information

Projects for later versions include:

- Optional adding and removing of new roles? (We don't currently have major roles in the RPI server but that could be explored)
- rpi mailing list updates
- LaTeX rendering
- verification for alums?
- setup program to get initial scrape data and set majors/etc
- more SIS-man themed fun
